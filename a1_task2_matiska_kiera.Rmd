```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# attach packages
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(AICcmodavg)
library(equatiomatic)
```

## Read in data

```{r}
seawater_chem <- read_csv(here("data", "calcofi_seawater_samples.csv"))
```

## Create two multiple linear regression models

- Model 1: Oxygen saturation as a function of water temperature, salinity, and phosphate concentration
- Model 2: Oxygen saturation as a function of water temp, salinity, phosphate concentration, and depth.

```{r}
f1 <- o2sat ~ t_deg_c + salinity + po4u_m
mdl1 <- lm(f1, data = seawater_chem)

f2 <- o2sat ~ t_deg_c + salinity + po4u_m + depth_m
mdl2 <- lm(f2, seawater_chem)
```

### Compare AIC values for the two models

```{r}
AIC(mdl1, mdl2) # 618.3868, 615.7016

AICc(mdl1) # 619.0251
AICc(mdl2) # 616.6048
```

Based on the AIC scores, the second model is the better out of the two
